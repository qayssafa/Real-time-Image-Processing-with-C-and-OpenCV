# Real-time-Image-Processing-with-C-and-OpenCV
Developed a program using C++ and OpenCV to access the laptop's camera frames and perform various image processing operations. The completed tasks encompassed displaying the original image, overlaying the image with real-time frames-per-second (FPS) count, presenting the image in blue, removing the blue color from the image, displaying it in grayscale, adding a logo to the image, and implementing image cropping with a flip operation applied to the bottom half.
